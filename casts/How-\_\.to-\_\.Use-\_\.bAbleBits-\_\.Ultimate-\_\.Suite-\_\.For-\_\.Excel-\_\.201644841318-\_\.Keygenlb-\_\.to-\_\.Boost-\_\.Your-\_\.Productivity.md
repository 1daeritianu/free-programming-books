## Merge Tables
 
One of the most common tasks in Excel is to merge data from two or more tables based on a common column or key. This can be done with formulas like VLOOKUP or INDEX/MATCH, but they can be complicated and error-prone.
 
With **AbleBits Ultimate Suite For Excel 2016.4.484.1318 Keygenl**, you can use the Merge Tables Wizard to quickly and easily pull matching data from another table without writing any formulas.
 
For example, suppose you have two tables: one with customer names and emails, and another with customer names and orders. You want to combine them into one table with customer names, emails, and orders.
 
To do this, you can follow these steps:
 
1. Select any cell in the first table and click Merge Tables on the Ablebits Data tab.
2. Select the second table as the lookup table and click Next.
3. Select the column that contains the common values (Customer Name) in both tables and click Next.
4. Select the columns that you want to add to the main table (Order) and click Next.
5. Choose how to handle duplicates and missing values and click Finish.

You will get a new table with the merged data in a few seconds.
 
## Find Duplicates
 
Another common task in Excel is to find duplicate values in a range or a table. This can help you identify errors, inconsistencies, or redundancies in your data.
 
With **AbleBits Ultimate Suite For Excel 2016.4.484.1318 Keygenl**, you can use the Duplicate Remover tool to quickly and easily find and remove duplicates in one or more columns.
 
For example, suppose you have a table with product names and prices, and you want to find out if there are any products with the same name but different prices.
 
To do this, you can follow these steps:

1. Select any cell in the table and click Duplicate Remover on the Ablebits Data tab.
2. Select the column that contains the values to check for duplicates (Product Name) and click Next.
3. Select the column that contains the values to compare for duplicates (Price) and click Next.
4. Choose how to mark or delete the duplicates and click Finish.

You will get a list of duplicate products with different prices highlighted or removed.
 
## Change Case
 
A simple but useful task in Excel is to change the case of text values in a range or a table. This can help you standardize your data or improve its readability.
 
With **AbleBits Ultimate Suite For Excel 2016.4.484.1318 Keygenl**, you can use the Change Case tool to quickly and easily change the case of text values to UPPER, lower, Proper, or Sentence case.
 
For example, suppose you have a table with customer names in
